        <p>
          With consumers replacing computers, phones, tables and laptops and
          other electronic goods more and more often these days, our landfills
          are becoming full of these obsolete and broken devices. Some of the
          components can be recycled. Many electronic products can be recycled
          and re-used but only about 22% of e-waste is recycled which means that
          78% ends up as trash. Millions of tons of e-waste gets shipped around
          the world for other countries to try and extract some value from the
          rubbish. In doing so, the harm caused by e-waste is not restricted to
          the country of the consumer but also to many of the developing
          countries of the world. Old but functioning electronic equipment that
          is surplus to requirements for some Government Departments and
          businesses can be refurbished for use by disadvantaged communities. In
          this way, the quantity of e-waste to landfill can be reduced.

        <h1>Where does e-waste go?</h1>

        <p>
          Most e-waste trash ends up in landfill, where it stays, as e-waste is
          not biodegradable. This means that huge amounts of land is needed to
          contain and store all the unrecycled e-waste. Health and the
          Environment:

        <p>
          E-waste also causes serious environmental problems because of many
          toxic chemicals used in electronic devices. These toxic chemicals,
          like mercury, arsenic, barium and lead, pollute the air, water and
          soil which harms our health, and that of animals, and damages
          ecosystems. Data Security:

          If computer hard drives are not wiped clean or destroyed at the time
          of disposal then some sensitive data can be recovered from these hard
          drives found in e-waste.
